### Hi there 👋

**Ahsan689/Ahsan689** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 👋 I'm Ahsan, a MERN stack developer with 2 years of experience in building full-stack web applications.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning backend languages and frameworks to improve my development skills.
- 💼 I'm currently working at BrainCrop as a Software Engineer.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Smart Vending App – our smart vending app is a modern and user-friendly solution that allows users to purchase snacks, drinks, and other products from vending machines. The app is built using Electron, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, which ensures a smooth and responsive experience for users. With our app, users can easily browse products, view prices, and make payments through a secure payment gateway. Additionally, the app also provides real-time updates on inventory levels, sales data, and machine maintenance needs, which helps vending machine owners to manage their business more efficiently. Our smart vending app is an innovative and cost-effective solution that revolutionizes the traditional vending machine experience.

- 🛠️ Some of the tools and technologies I use on a daily basis are:
- JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Git, VS Code
- 👯 I'm open to collaborate on open source projects related to MERN stack.
